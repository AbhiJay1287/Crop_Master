In this project, Crop_Master simplifies crop selection for farmers by deploying an intelligent model. By analyzing soil composition including sodium content, pH, potassium levels, and more, our system provides tailored recommendations. With SmartCrop, farmers can make informed decisions to optimize yield and sustainability, enhancing agricultural practices with ease.
